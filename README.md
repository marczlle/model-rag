RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an advanced technique that combines information retrieval with text generation to improve 
the quality and accuracy of responses in artificial intelligence systems, especially in language models like GPT.
In this case, a private knowledge base (the book Alice in Wonderland) was used, and the system provides the best answer to the question 
by leveraging vector proximity to identify the most relevant information.
